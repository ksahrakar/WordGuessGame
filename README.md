This is a hangman-type word guess game diguised as a neuroanatomy tutor. The user is presented with a string of empty boxes to represent the letters of the secret word. The user gets 10 tries to guess the word. Incorrect letters are added to a list, and correct letters are inserted in the word. A small "hint" picture pointing to the structure to be guessed is diplayed. A total of wins and losses is also presented to the user. Enjoy!
